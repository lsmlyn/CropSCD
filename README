## Cropland-SCD

The pytorch implementation for **MeGNet** in paper "[A Memory Guided Network and A Novel Dataset for Cropland Semantic Change Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10579791/)" on [IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/RecentIssue.jsp?punumber=36).  

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- Pytorch 1.7.0


## Datasets
### CropLand Senmantic Change Dection (CropSCD) Dataset
The CropSCD dataset contains 4,141 pairs of high-resolution samples, each with a size of 512Ã—512 and a resolution between 0.5-2 meters.
All images of the samples were randomly collected from rural areas of Guangdong Province, China, while their corresponding labels were precisely annotated through expert visual interpretation.
The dataset contains a total of eight distinct change classes, which include Water, Forest, Plantation, Grassland, Impervious Surface, Greenhouse, Road, and Bare Soil.
